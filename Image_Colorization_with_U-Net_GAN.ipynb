    "This one is a little complicated and needs explanation. This code implements a U-Net to be used as the generator of our GAN. The details of the code are out of the scope of this article but the important thing to understand is that it makes the U-Net from the middle part of it (down in the U shape) and adds down-sampling and up-sampling modules to the left and right of that middle module (respectively) at every iteration until it reaches the input module and output module. Look at the following image that I made from one of the images in the article to give you a better sense of what is happening in the code:\n",

    "![unet](./files/unet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The blue rectangles show the order in which the related modules are built with the code. The U-Net we will build has more layers than what is depicted in this image but it suffices to give you the idea. Also notice in the code that we are going 8 layers down, so if we start with a 256 by 256 image, in the middle of the U-Net we will get a 1 by 1 (256 / 2⁸) image and then it gets up-sampled to produce a  256 by 256 image (with two channels). This code snippet is really exciting and I highly recommend to play with it to fully grasp what every line of it is doing."

In a vanilla discriminator, the model outputs one number (a scaler) which represents how much the model thinks the input (which is the whole image) is real (or fake). In a patch discriminator, the model outputs one number for every patch of say 70 by 70 pixels of the input image and for each of them decides whether it is fake or not separately. Using such a model for the task of colorization seems reasonable to me because the local changes that the model needs to make are really important and maybe deciding on the whole image as in vanilla discriminator cannot take care of the subtleties of this task. Here, the model's output shape is 30 by 30 but it does not mean that our patches are 30 by 30. The actual patch size is obtained when you compute the receptive field of each of these 900 (30 multiplied by 30) output numbers which in our case will be 70 by 70."
